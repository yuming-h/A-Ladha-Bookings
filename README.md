# A-Ladha-Bookings
Designed for the Science Undergraduate Society of UBC to streamline the approval process for bookings in the Abdul Ladha Science Student Centre. This is a Python script that pulls and parses user entry data using the Typeform API and pushes calendar data to the SUS website using Google Calendar API. Also automatically generates LaTeX invoices and sends confirmation emails to bookees.
