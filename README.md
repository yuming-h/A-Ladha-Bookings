  An all-in-one Python script I wrote to replace me!

## Motivation

Much of my job as Building Manager at the Abdul Ladha Science Student Centre (ALSSC) is very fun and inspired work, but many portions of it involve boring, menial - and therefore automatable - tasks. So, my obvious solution was to write a program to cover these parts for me so I could focus on improving the building space for all science students at UBC.



## Features

- ⚡ Faster than me.
- 🔣 Calculates costs of rentals based on factors such as number of hours, late hours, weekends, internal vs. external organizations, etc.
- 📝 Self-documenting (not in a code-sense, but also in a code-sense). Generates invoices with LaTeX for bookees.
-  📜 Schedules building supervisors to oversee student events.
- 📧 Email notifications.
- 📆 Pushes event data to the Science Undergraduate Society (SUS) website to alert students on when the building is being booked or free to study in.
