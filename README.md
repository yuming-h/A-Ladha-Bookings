  A neat little Python program I wrote to replace me!
</p>

## Motivation

Much of my job as Building Manager at the Abdul Ladha Science Student Centre (ALSSC) is very fun and inspired work, but many portions of it involve boring, menial - and therefore automatable - tasks. So, my obvious solution was to write a program to cover these parts for me so I could focus on the real parts of the job, that is, improving the building space and experience for all science students at UBC. 

NOTE: This was my first programming project so unfortunately the code is not too clean :(



## Features

- ⚡ Faster than me.
- 🔣 Calculates costs of rentals based on factors such as number of hours, late hours, weekends, internal vs. external organizations, etc.
- 📝 Self-documenting (not in a code-sense, but maybe also in a code-sense): generates invoices with LaTeX for every event booking.
- 📜 Schedules building supervisors to oversee student events.
- 📧 Email notifications for bookees.
- 📆 Pushes event data to the Science Undergraduate Society (SUS) website to let students know when the building is being booked or free to study in.
